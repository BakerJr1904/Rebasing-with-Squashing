# rebaising-with-squashing
Lets make history clean by creating a single commit for every feature branch.<br/><br/>
Can you squash and rebase?<br/>
YES! It's simple and called: The squash rebase workflow.
Before you merge a feature branch back into your main branch, your feature branch should be squashed down to a single buildable commit, and then rebased from the up-to-date main branch.
